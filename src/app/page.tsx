      <GradientWelcome>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I&apos;m Joe.</GradientWelcome>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a frontend engineer with close to a decade in the industry, cutting
        my teeth on WordPress sites before diving headfirst into modern
        JavaScript frameworks. For the past 6â€“7 years, my world has revolved
        around TypeScript, Vue, React, and Next.jsâ€”building everything from
        marketing pages to complex, scalable web apps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve worn a few hats along the way: Web Developer, Frontend Engineer,
        Tech Lead, and now Head of Engineering. Iâ€™ve led small, focused teams
        and worked closely with stakeholders to turn product ideas into real,
        valuable software. Iâ€™ve shipped on platforms like Vercel, Amplify, and
        DigitalOcean, and Iâ€™ve got a loose but growing handle on the broader AWS
        suite.
      </p>

      <p>
        What drives me isnâ€™t just the tech (though I love a clean component or a
        well-architected system). Itâ€™s solving interesting problems, making
        sense of complexity, and communicating clearly - whether itâ€™s in code, a
        product spec, or a 1:1 with a teammate. Frameworks come and go, but that
        mindset is what makes an engineer great.
