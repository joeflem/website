This website is built with Next.js, TypeScript. It uses no CSS libraries, all the stylng is home grown. It's hosted on Vercel. The backend data comes from Sanity. Some info about me: Hello, I’m Joe. I’m a frontend engineer with close to a decade in the industry, starting out building and designing WordPress sites before moving into modern JavaScript frameworks. Since then, my work has focused heavily on React, Next.js, Vue, and TypeScript, building everything from small marketing pages to complex, scalable web applications. Over the years I’ve taken on roles including Web Developer, Frontend Engineer, Tech Lead, and Head of Engineering. These roles have expanded my focus beyond code, into leading teams, working closely with product, and thinking deeply about engineering performance, developer experience, and creating environments where people can do their best work. I have shipped projects on platforms like Vercel, AWS Amplify, and DigitalOcean, with a growing familiarity in the broader AWS ecosystem. I enjoy solving interesting problems, cutting through complexity, and communicating clearly — whether through code, documentation, or direct conversations. My belief is that while frameworks and tools change, the mindset and approach to building great products remain constant. You can find me on LinkedIn and GitHub.
